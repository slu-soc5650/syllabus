### Scheduling Notes

The course schedule may change as it depends on the progress of the class and the <a href = "https://slu-soc5650.github.io/covid19" target = "_blank">challenges we are confronted by this semester</a>. The web version of this document will be updated to reflect any alterations, but the .pdf version will remain unaltered.

No class activities are scheduled for **May 10th**. This is a “flex day,” which I have left without a scheduled plan to accommodate changes due to COVID-19. If we have to reschedule class days, this date will be used before we begin to remove content from the course plan. I will provide updates on my plans for both of these days as the semester progresses.

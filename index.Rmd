## Hardcopy Syllabus {-}
If you would like to keep a record of the syllabus, there is a `.pdf` download button (<i class="fa fa-file-pdf-o"></i>) in the top toolboar. This may be particularly useful for honors and M.A. students who plan to continue their graduate education after SLU and hope to petition out of a basic statistics requirement. This document will contain a "snapshot" of the course policies and planned schedule as of the beginning of the semester but will not be subsequently updated. See the "Preface and Warning" on page 2 of the `.pdf` for additional details.

# Assignments and Grading
This section provides general details on the different types of assignments for this course. It also contains policies for submitting work, receiving feedback, and late work.

## Assignments
Your grade for this course will consist of a number of different assignments on which points may be earned. Each category of assignment is described below.

### Attendance and Participation

\begin{rmdtip}
Attendance and participation are worth \textbf{10\%} of your final
grade.
\end{rmdtip}

Both attendance and participation are critically important aspects of this class. The class participation grade will be based on (a) attendance, (b) level of engagement during lectures and labs, (c) level of engagement on Slack, and (d) the completion of other exercises including "entry" and "exit" tickets, the student information sheet, a pre-test, and an end of the semester course evaluation. 

Each of these elements is assigned a point value and assessed using a scale that awards full, partial, or no credit. Your participation grade will be split, with 50 points (5% of your final grade) for the first half of the semester (through Lecture-08) and another 50 points (5%) for the second half. Since the number of points awarded for participation are variable, the total number of points earned for each half will be converted to a 0 to 50 scale. 

I provide the final number of points earned for each half of the course. If you would like a more detailed breakdown of your participation grade, please reach out and I will provide one.

### Lab Exercises

\begin{rmdtip}
Labs are worth \textbf{24\%} of your final grade.
\end{rmdtip}

Each course meeting (except the first) will include time dedicated to practicing the techniques and applying the theories described during the day's lecture. These exercises will give you an opportunity to practice skills that correspond with the first four course objectives. Instructions for the labs will be posted in the lecture repositories on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/slu-soc5650) and will be linked to from the lecture pages on the [**course website**](https://slu-soc5650.github.io/). The instructions will also detail the deliverables to be submitted to demonstrate completion of each assignment. Replication files are also provided in the lecture repositories on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/slu-soc5650).

There will be a total of fifteen lab exercises over the course of the semester, each of which is worth 16 points (1.6% of your final grade). Lab exercises are graded using the “check” grading system. Since replication files are posted, feedback for labs is not generally returned after the first few assignments and I will only respond with the number of points awarded if you do not earn full credit.

### Problem Sets

\begin{rmdtip}
Problem sets are worth \textbf{30\%} of your final grade.
\end{rmdtip}

Problem sets will require students to draw on a variety of skills, including cleaning data, performing statistical analyses, producing plots, and reporting results. They are designed to assess your progress with the first four course objectives. Instructions for the problem sets will be posted in the lecture repositories on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/slu-soc5650) and will be linked to from the lecture pages on the [**course website**](https://slu-soc5650.github.io/). The instructions will also detail the deliverables to be submitted to demonstrate completion of each assignment. Replication files that illustrate my approach to each problem set will be posted on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/slu-soc5650) in the [`Replications`](https://github.com/slu-soc5650/Replications) repository once all students have submitted their problem sets.

There will be a total of six problem sets over the course of the semester, each of which is worth 50 points (5% of your final grade). Each Problem Set will include a simple rubric describing how each problem set is evaluated. A key aspect of these assignments is not only demonstrating comfort with a particular set of GIS skills, but also demonstrating and evolving in your analysis development, programming, and cartographic skills as well. The weight given to quality of your process and code will increase as the semester progresses.

### Final Project

\begin{rmdtip}
The final project is worth, in total, \textbf{36\%} of your final grade.
Depending on your section, it will be broken down into a variety of
assignments, each of which has their own point value. See below for
details.
\end{rmdtip}

The final project corresponds with the fourth learning outcome. It will be organized slightly differently depending on which section you are enrolled in. Specific instructions will be provided in the [**final project guide**](https://slu-soc5650.github.io/finalGuide), and updates will be posted on the [**course website's**](https://slu-soc5650.github.io/) [**final project page**](https://slu-soc5650.github.io/final-project). 

As work progresses, there will be a number of **waypoints** where students will need to submit updates on their progress. Waypoints beyond the memo submission are as follows:

1. Lecture-04 (**February 4^th^**) - select and submit their topic as an "Issue" in their individual [**GitHub**](https://github.com/slu-soc5650) assignments repository.
2. Lecture-08 (**March 4^th^**) - progress report from each student due as a GitHub issue in each student's final project repository
3. Lecture-11 (**March 25^th^**) - progress report from each student due as a GitHub issue in each student's final project repository
4. Lecture-13 (**April 8^th^**) - draft materials due in each student's final project repository
5. Lecture-14 (**April 15^th^**) - peer reviews due as a GitHub issue in partner's final project repository
6. Lecture-16 (**April 29^th^**) - progress report from each student due as a GitHub issue in each student's final project repository 

Deliverables for each waypoint are described in the [**final project guide**](https://slu-soc5650.github.io/finalGuide). All waypoints are graded using the "check" grading system. Final materials will be due on **May 13^th^** (during Finals Week), when we will hold a "research conference" in the Busch Student Center. During our conference, each student will present their research posters. Final deliverables differ by course section.

#### SOC 4650
If you are enrolled in SOC 4650, you will need to create a research poster that provides thematic maps of your topic.

Final Code \& Docs & 100 pts & x1 & 100 pts\\
Final Poster & 100 pts & x1 & 100 pts\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

#### SOC 5650
If you are enrolled in SOC 5650, you will also need to create a digital paper that combines the scholarly literature on your topic with interactive and static maps. This can be created using `R` (using `radix`) or ArcGIS Pro (a story map). The following additional deadlines apply:

1. Lecture-08 (**March 4^th^**) - annotated Bibliography with a minimum of fifteen peer reviewed sources
2. Lecture-13 (**April 8^th^**) - a draft story map or `radix` document due in each student's final project repository
3. Lecture-14 (**April 15^th^**) - peer reviews of the story map or `radix` document due as a GitHub issue in partner's final project repository

Grading for SOC 5650 is broken down as follows:

## Submission and Late Work

### Assignment Submission

Copies of all assignment requested deliverables should be uploaded to your private assignments repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/slu-soc5650) before class on the day that the assignments are due. All assignments will contain details on required deliverables.

The GitHub submission policy is in place because it facilitates clear, easy grading that can be turned around to you quickly. Submitting assignments in ways that deviate from this policy will result in a late grade (see below) being applied in the first instance and a zero grade for each subsequent instance.

### Licensing of Student Work

All assignment repositories are licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). This license explicitly gives you copyright to all work you create for this course. The license gives Chris permission to copy your work (such as for grading) and to re-use your work later for non-commercial purposes (such as in-class examples) so long as you are given credit for it. However, your work cannot be used for monetary gain (such as in a textbook) and derivative works based on your work are prohibited.

The syllabus agreement at the end of the Student Information Sheet includes an acknowledgement of this licensing arrangement. If you have questions about this, please contact Chris before submitting the form.

### Late Work

Once the class begins, any assignments submitted will be treated as late. Assignments handed in within 24-hours of the beginning of class will have 15% deducted from the grade. I will deduct 15% per day for the next two 24-hour periods that assignments are late. After 72 hours, I will not accept late work. If you cannot attend class because of personal illness, a family issue, jury duty, an athletic match, or a religious observance, you must contact me beforehand to discuss alternate submission of work.

## Extra Credit

From time to time I may offer extra credit to be applied to your final grade. I will only offer extra credit if it is open to the entire class (typically for something like attending a lecture or event on-campus). If I offer extra credit, I will typically require you to submit a short written summary of the activity within a week of the event to obtain the credit. When offered, extra credit opportunities cannot be made-up or substituted if you are unable to attend the event.

## Grading

Grades will be included with assignment feedback, which will be disseminated through Github’s **Issues** tool. At midterms, Lecture-17, and finals, I will upload a summary of all assignment grades to a new **Issue** on GitHub.

All grades that use a “check” system (the lecture preps, labs, and some aspects of the final project) will be calculated using the following approach. A “check-plus” represents excellent work and will get full credit. A “check” represents satisfactory work and will get 85% of the points available for that assignment. A “check-minus” represents work that needs substantial improvement and will get 75% of the points available for that assignment.

I use a point system for calculating grades. The following table gives the weighting and final point totals for all assignments for this course:

\begin{table}

\caption{(\#tab:unnamed-chunk-7)SOC 4650 and 5650 Points Breakdown}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{lllll}
\toprule
Assignment & Points & Quantity & Total & Percent\\
\midrule
Participation & 50 pts & x2 & 100 pts & 10\%\\
Labs & 16 pts & x15 & 240 pts & 24\%\\
Problem Sets & 50 pts & x6 & 300 pts & 30\%\\
Final Project & 360 pts & x1 & 360 pts & 36\%\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

All feedback will include grades that represent number of points earned. If you want to know your percentage on a particular assignment, divide the number of points earned by the number of points possible and then multiply it by 100.

Final grades will be calculated by taking the sum of all points earned and dividing it by the total number of points possible (1,000). This will be multiplied by 100 and then converted to a letter grade using the
following table:

\begin{table}
\caption{(\#tab:unnamed-chunk-8)Course Grading Scale}

\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{lll}
\toprule
GPA & Letter & Percent\\
\midrule
4.0 & A & 93.0\% - 100\%\\
3.7 & A- & 90.0\% - 92.9\%\\
3.3 & B+ & 87.0\% - 89.9\%\\
3.0 & B & 83.0\% - 86.9\%\\
2.7 & B- & 80.0\% - 82.9\%\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{lll}
\toprule
GPA & Letter & Percent\\
\midrule
2.3 & C+ & 77.0\% - 79.9\%\\
2.0 & C & 73.0\% - 76.9\%\\
1.7 & C- & 70.0\% - 72.9\%\\
1.0 & D & 63.0\% - 69.9\%\\
0.0 & F & < 63.0\%\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Borderline grades (i.e. a grade within half a percentage point of the next highest letter grade) *will* be rounded up before final grade submission at the end of the semester. A grade of 89.6% would therefore be submitted to SLU as an "A-" while a grade of 89.4% would be submitted to SLU as a "B+". The final grade report will include both the original letter grade and the rounded letter grade if applicable.

\begin{rmdwarning}
No chances will be given for revisions of poor grades. Incomplete grades
will be given upon request only if you have a ``C'' average and have
completed at least two-thirds of the assignments. You should note that
incomplete grades must be rectified by the specified deadline or they
convert to an ``F''.
\end{rmdwarning}

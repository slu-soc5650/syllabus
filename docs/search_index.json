["assignments.html", "4.1 Assignments", " 4.1 Assignments Your grade for this course will consist of a number of different assignments on which points may be earned. Each category of assignment is described below. 4.1.1 Attendance and Participation Attendance and participation are worth 10% of your final grade. Both attendance and participation are critically important aspects of this class. The class participation grade will be based on (a) attendance, (b) level of engagement during lectures and labs, (c) level of engagement on Slack, and (d) the completion of other exercises including “entry” and “exit” tickets, the student information sheet, a pre-test, and an end of the semester course evaluation. Each of these elements is assigned a point value and assessed using a scale that awards full, partial, or no credit. Your participation grade will be split, with 50 points (5% of your final grade) for the first half of the semester (through Lecture-08) and another 50 points (5%) for the second half. Since the number of points awarded for participation are variable, the total number of points earned for each half will be converted to a 0 to 50 scale. I provide the final number of points earned for each half of the course. If you would like a more detailed breakdown of your participation grade, please reach out and I will provide one. 4.1.2 Lab Exercises Labs are worth 24% of your final grade. Each course meeting (except the first) will include time dedicated to practicing the techniques and applying the theories described during the day’s lecture. These exercises will give you an opportunity to practice skills that correspond with the first four course objectives. Instructions for the labs will be posted in the lecture repositories on GitHub and will be linked to from the lecture pages on the course website. The instructions will also detail the deliverables to be submitted to demonstrate completion of each assignment. Replication files are also provided in the lecture repositories on GitHub. There will be a total of fifteen lab exercises over the course of the semester, each of which is worth 16 points (1.6% of your final grade). Lab exercises are graded using the “check” grading system. Since replication files are posted, feedback for labs is not generally returned after the first few assignments and I will only respond with the number of points awarded if you do not earn full credit. 4.1.3 Problem Sets Problem sets are worth 30% of your final grade. Problem sets will require students to draw on a variety of skills, including cleaning data, performing statistical analyses, producing plots, and reporting results. They are designed to assess your progress with the first four course objectives. Instructions for the problem sets will be posted in the lecture repositories on GitHub and will be linked to from the lecture pages on the course website. The instructions will also detail the deliverables to be submitted to demonstrate completion of each assignment. Replication files that illustrate my approach to each problem set will be posted on GitHub in the Replications repository once all students have submitted their problem sets. There will be a total of six problem sets over the course of the semester, each of which is worth 50 points (5% of your final grade). Each Problem Set will include a simple rubric describing how each problem set is evaluated. A key aspect of these assignments is not only demonstrating comfort with a particular set of GIS skills, but also demonstrating and evolving in your analysis development, programming, and cartographic skills as well. The weight given to quality of your process and code will increase as the semester progresses. 4.1.4 Final Project The final project is worth, in total, 36% of your final grade. Depending on your section, it will be broken down into a variety of assignments, each of which has their own point value. See below for details. The final project corresponds with the fourth learning outcome. It will be organized slightly differently depending on which section you are enrolled in. Specific instructions will be provided in the final project guide, and updates will be posted on the course website’s final project page. As work progresses, there will be a number of waypoints where students will need to submit updates on their progress. Waypoints beyond the memo submission are as follows: Lecture-04 (February 4th) - select and submit their topic as an “Issue” in their individual GitHub assignments repository. Lecutre-08 (March 4th) - progress report from each student due as a GitHub issue in each student’s final project repository Lecture-11 (March 25th) - progress report from each student due as a GitHub issue in each student’s final project repository Lecture-13 (April 8th) - draft materials due in each student’s final project repository Lecture-14 (April 15th) - peer reviews due as a GitHub issue in partner’s final project repository Lecture-16 (April 29th) - progress report from each student due as a GitHub issue in each student’s final project repository Deliverables for each waypoint are described in the final project guide. All waypoints are graded using the “check” grading system. Final materials will be due on May 13th (during Finals Week), when we will hold a “research conference” in the Busch Student Center. During our conference, each student will present their research posters. Final deliverables differ by course section. 4.1.4.1 SOC 4650 If you are enrolled in SOC 4650, you will need to create a research poster that provides thematic maps of your topic.
